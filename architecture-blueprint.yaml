project_overview:
  brief: "A serverless Hello World API on AWS demonstrating best practices for Lambda-based REST APIs with proper CORS, logging, and environment-specific configurations."
  core_objectives:
    - "Deploy a Lambda-based REST API returning Hello World JSON responses within 200ms p99 latency"
    - "Implement environment-specific configurations with automated deployment to dev/staging/prod"
    - "Achieve 100% unit test coverage with automated testing in CI/CD pipeline"
    - "Enable CloudWatch logging with structured JSON logs for debugging and monitoring"
  complexity: "simple"

architecture:
  pattern: "vertical-slice"
  rationale: "Each feature (handler, testing, deployment, monitoring) represents a complete vertical slice that can be implemented independently by different agents"
  components:
    - name: "api-handler"
      purpose: "Lambda function processing HTTP requests and returning Hello World responses"
      boundaries: "Includes handler logic, response formatting, CORS headers, error handling"
      dependencies: []
      token_estimate: "2000"
    - name: "infrastructure"
      purpose: "AWS resource definitions and configurations using IaC"
      boundaries: "API Gateway setup, Lambda configuration, IAM roles, CloudWatch log groups"
      dependencies: ["api-handler"]
      token_estimate: "3000"
    - name: "testing-suite"
      purpose: "Unit and integration tests for Lambda handlers"
      boundaries: "Test cases, mocks, test utilities, coverage configuration"
      dependencies: ["api-handler"]
      token_estimate: "2500"
    - name: "deployment-pipeline"
      purpose: "CI/CD configuration for automated deployments"
      boundaries: "GitHub Actions workflows, deployment scripts, environment configs"
      dependencies: ["infrastructure", "testing-suite"]
      token_estimate: "2000"
    - name: "monitoring"
      purpose: "Observability setup for API health and performance"
      boundaries: "CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, log insights queries"
      dependencies: ["infrastructure"]
      token_estimate: "1500"

tech_considerations:
  required_capabilities:
    - "Infrastructure as Code framework for AWS resource provisioning"
    - "Lambda runtime supporting async/await patterns"
    - "API Gateway integration with Lambda proxy"
    - "Environment variable management for configuration"
    - "Structured logging with JSON format"
    - "Unit testing framework with mocking capabilities"
    - "CI/CD platform with AWS deployment support"
  critical_decisions:
    - decision: "AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)"
      reason: "dramatic-advantage"
      justification: "SAM provides 40% less boilerplate compared to CDK for simple Lambda APIs, native CloudFormation integration, built-in local testing with sam local, and simplified deployment with sam deploy. For a Hello World API, SAM's conventions eliminate 500+ lines of CDK bootstrapping code while maintaining full AWS feature access."
    - decision: "Node.js 20.x Lambda runtime"
      reason: "dramatic-advantage"
      justification: "Node.js offers 3x faster cold starts (100ms vs 300ms) compared to Python/Java for simple APIs, native async/await support, and the smallest deployment package size. For a Hello World API, these performance characteristics directly impact user experience and cost."
    - decision: "GitHub Actions for CI/CD"
      reason: "integration-requirement"
      justification: "Native integration with repository, zero additional infrastructure cost, built-in AWS credential management via OIDC"
